Welcome to Chris Raphel's final project for Phase-1 at Flatiron School. In this project we are going to play a well a known card game, a game which I have played and loved for a long time, War. 

I chose to use the public API, *https://deckofcardsapi.com/ which provided me data for a deck of cards, reshuffling cards, putting cards back into the pile, card images, and drawing cards. 

 
The RULES - To start, this game consists of two players, the user (you) and the dealer (your opponent, in this case the computer). You are each dealt one card face up. Whoever has the highest card number wins that game. Winner of each game gets 1 point added to their score
 Whichever player gets to 10 points first wins. This game has several features and displays within it including:
*The game begins with a "start" button (event listener - click) located beneath the deck of cards. You can also press the space bar to start a new game (keydown event listener). 
*Each drawn card has the image of that playing card including number and suit. Cards are displayed next to the corresponding user player. 
*Player scoreboards are displayed above corresponding players profile.
*Mouseover event is fired when player hovers over his scoreboard which also fires a focus event listener. The same thing happens if mouse is hover 


Several objects with attributes:
    "success": true, 
    "deck_id": "kxozasf3edqu", 
    "cards": [
             "code" "image" "value" Suit"
    "remaining": 50
    "shuffled"
    "piles"
        "discard"
